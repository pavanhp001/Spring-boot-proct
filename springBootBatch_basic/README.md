Spring Boot â€“ Batch tutorial using MySQL, JPA and annotations

In this example I show how to use Spring Boot to create a simple Spring Batch application.
I used the same architecture in a production software. Spring Boot is great to improve productivity but the documentation is still sparse (the framework is still in 0.5 version).

You can find more details here:

The only requirement is to have a mysql database installed.
You can find more information in the source code.

If you start a new project in an IDE, you can simply create a simple new maven project (without Spring wizards or similar).
