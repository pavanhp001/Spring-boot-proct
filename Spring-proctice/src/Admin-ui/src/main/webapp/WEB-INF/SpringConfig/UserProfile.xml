    Bean that manages the user profile. User's security principal is set in the web application in
    an interceptor and thus will be made available to all classes that refer to this bean. This bean also
    makes access to the user's profile attributes feasible as well as maintenance of a few of them.

    This bean is not the administrative user maintenance bean.

    TODO consider moving some of the bean attributes that are set using system properties into this file.
